        <h1>from bungalow home…</h1><p>
From bungalow home<br>
see sun-dried hills lay<br>
East of Oran<br>
fields in yellow wheat waves.<br> 
Once in a while when the sun is down,<br>
coyotes howl at bright crescent moon.<br> 
see trees on every hill<br> 
wilt away<br> 
cold season.<br> 
mounts of box houses<br> 
connected by long windy lonely road<br> 
one side there are cows and turkeys<br> 
other has a Vietnam memorial symbolized with two boulders with bronze plaques mounted on them and a blank white American flag pole jabbing into the sky, about 25 feet.<br>
aside from the grey metal hill scaffolding<br>
Its a <a href="Madeline.html">red brick town</a>.<br> 
chimneys on every home.<br> 
smoke in the sky make nighttime darkness a little darker in<br> 
Oran.<br>
down by <a href="mother.html">the feet level</a> where<br> 
red bricks hit the ground<br> 
7 languages, 13 races, and 212 creeds<br> 
street lamps hang from wires by building<br>
building<br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; building<br> 
light all lights at 7 &nbsp; &nbsp; (1234567)<br>
illuminate Oran little, little.<br> 
Urban night.
