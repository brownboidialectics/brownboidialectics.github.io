        <h1>mother…</h1><p>
mother speaks with a thick tongue.<br>
silent walk across brown wood floorboards<br>
gaze with gentle grace.<br> 
speaking proud, she sings in quechua waves that<br> 
tia sung,<br> 
abuelita<br> 
y la que sigue.<br> 
accent dwelling in her mouth<br> 
arepas in english and spanish,<br> 
so there is no quiet<br> 
there is no silence,<br> 
its been to long since the voice of voiceless<br> 
escuchado<br> 
speaking sancocho and Plena<br> 
riding through streets of <a href="from_bungalow_home.html">North Bergen</a><br> 
say listó<br>
english too tight<br>
too heavy<br> 
too neat<br> 
too black and white.<br> 
sing colors, painting shadows with sun red brush<br> 
mother sister brother, all thick tongued<br> 
can't speak without bone without the sweet whistle of the <a href="sitting_at_the_center.html">pan flute</a>, without any clave<br>
the words spill in conversation and hit the floor like wine<br>
        </p></body></html>
