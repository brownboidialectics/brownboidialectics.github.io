        <h1>Madeline</h1><p> 
Madeleine came over late evening<br>
last night<br>
touching and kissing<br> 
i hadn't seen her in a long time<br> 
she has baggy eyes<br> 
baggier than before,<br> 
i have sad pants<br> 
sadder than before.<br> 
In mendocino<br> 
feeling like mad man &&<br>
woman<br> 
escapist journey<br> 
<a href="from_bungalow_home.html">American Dream</a>,<br> 
101, 5, 4, and 1<br>
California<br> 
wild ostrich on the<br>
highway.<br> 
<br>

Madeline's finance <a href="as_sea_rocks_scraped.html">died</a> 6 months ago<br> 
she bereaved the night<br> 
before last night<br> 
tonight she's confused.<br> 
she never wanted to marry him.<br>
he read newspapers<br> 
she hates the smell<br> 
of fine print<br>
of hard liquor<br> 
he was a rum and coke drinker<br> 
who liked to fuck in the shower.<br> 
she likes the bed more.<br> 
<br>

Telling me this on small full sized bed<br> 
hotel room<br>
smoking floor<br> 
she smokes<br> 
i don’t<br> 
but do now. and we’re at war.<br>
