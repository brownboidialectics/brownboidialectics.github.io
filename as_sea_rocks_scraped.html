        <h1>as sea rocks scraped...</h1>
        <p>    
    As sea rocks scraped, at the bottom of the ship<br> 
    sirens whispered to each other hidden in the haze below the cliff.<br> 
    The captain awoke suddenly, gray wax had run from candle over compass<br> 
    his first mate’s fist banged furiously on the door,<br> 
    “Captain oh my Captain voices sound in the mist<br> 
    and they ask for your lovely maiden who lay in the brig<br> 
    I say come up on deck while me and the rest make sure she is well hid.”<br> 
    The captain sprung up from his desk and said “This vessel shall live, and that maiden is mine so…she shall answer for this”<br>
    “But Captain, you are the Captain I mean no disrespect, but you must protect that which is, thy treasure”<br> 
    The Captain let out a deep sea salt sigh, and replied “yeah I don’t know, I guess”<br>
    <br>

    “Okay, Get the girl” the Captain said, “I will respond to the hisses and growls in the fog, for I am a man, I am a captain, I am brave seafarer.<br>
    I will stand before God and I will answer his riddle of predetermined fate<br>
    For I am a man, so first: I must shave.”<br>
    <br>

    “But Captain should we not protect your lovely maiden who lay asleep in the brig, whose body is beckoned by the hisses and growls from within ?<br>
    Oh Captain are you sure that you are not just afraid, because anytime something scary happens you decide…It’s time to shave ?”<br>
    <br>

    “Shut up Stephan, Do as I say!<br>
    For I am a man and I say that this vessel shall live!”<br>
    <br>

    The captain grabbed his sailor-boy overcoat, his Irish catholic prayer beads, packed tobacco in his pipe and stood sadly on the deck thinking, ‘am I not a man, and If I am is that enough’.<br>
    <br>

    On the deck winged beasts fell from the fucking sky,<br>
    fell from the melted magenta of the sea night darkness<br> 
    And the creatures bellowed and laughed as they plopped into the orange and purple brine of the sea washing up against barnacled bilge<br> 
    The dark monsters sung in choir “what has become of your love, where does she lie, what has become of our love”<br> 
    The captain drew his long bade and waved it at the beast,<br> 
    His first mate had drawn back to the brig moaning with dread, and brought up the corpse of his <a href="Madeline.html">maiden</a> and laid it on the deck.<br>
    <br>

    Her lips had been torn off and her eyes where hidden in two red divots of blood<br> 
    And now the captain sang to the song of the winged beasts,<br> 
    “Oh what has become of my love, what has become of my love?”<br>
    The captain drew his long blade and bellowed “come out you things of darkness show yourselves for I am man and I will protect that which is”<br>
    At that moment the maiden stood and her flesh melted and frosted in front of the Captain’s eyes.<br>
    From her eye sockets emerged two rotting holes with two moths perched within.<br>
    The divine maiden then exhaled and dropped down hail stones that brought down the main mast and the sails.<br> 
    Jagged whispers fell from the mouths of the crew like confessions they had cried into Seashells before the maiden<br> 
    And the captain sat proudly on the deck holding on for dear life, and said to his crew, “You must protect that which is, You must protect that which is”<br>
    <br>

    The crew grabbed at the maiden’s floating corpse and clutched her against a plank of wood dangling over the sea.<br>
    And the captain laughed to himself on the deck, and said,<br>
    “I am a man, and I say this vessel shall live”.<br>
