        <h1>Rufino</h1><p>
Rufino puts pen to the page<br>
wears bandage on 2 fingers<br> 
ring and middle<br>
fearful of a genesis<br>
the beginning of anything<br>
& the end of all eternity.<br> 
rifles through pages of old work.<br> 
exercise, word counting, page feel<br> 
250 words<br>
Rufino wants 10,000 words.<br> 


Basement den,<br> 
metal chair,<br> 
desk, long piece of wood from Home Depot balanced upon two filing cabinets,<br> 
futon for collapsing<br> 
and cracked mirror.<br>  
5 hours has passed<br> 
1000 words:<br> 
story of young girl in Southwest.<br> 
Texas or Colorado.<br> 
innociencia is lusted over by sleepy men and boys<br>
“Every time Innociencia runs by the slaughterhouse which stands near the Foley Farms, the country boys drip sweat from their brows and watch her with keen eyes and sad hearts as they paint the grass with splotches of brown dip spit.”<br> 
<br>

Rufino writing rhythm<br>
<a href="one_day.html">oral pleasure</a>,<br>
through hands<br> 
that undress through the mirror<br>
3,000 words<br>
plot thickening,<br>
<a href="sitting_at_the_center.html">Innociencia</a> now 19<br>
works at dusty diner<br> 
serves them coffee in stainless steel mugs.<br>
large breasts<br>
short woman<br> 
hips wide<br>  
Rufino in the mirror!<br>
feeling paralysis<br> 
feeling chains<br>
feeling writing<br>
