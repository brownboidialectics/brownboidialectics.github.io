        <h1>One day…</h1><p>
One day,<br>
when the clouds rolled in and the<br>
diner was hidden under a drizzle of rain <br>
she drove down to California until she found Oakland, <br>
where she saw people go mad in the streets. <br>
great vegetation sprouting between the cracks in the concrete<br>
rain flooding Telegraph Avenue with a dark red ocean <br>
people coming to swim and drink in the earth. <br>
Where the sun goes down at 8 o’clock every night and the shutters go down <br>
the city is in uproar<br> 
the gritty iridescent street lamps bend over <br>
beautiful images of iron foliage<br>
streets glutted with the bodies of coroners,<br>
undertakers,<br> 
hookers,<br> 
beggars,<br> 
beasts,<br> 
<a href="Rufino.html">poets</a>,<br> 
sodemites,<br> 
devils,<br> 
angels,<br> 
& holy horrors who mill around the streets, equipped with cigarettes and booze, calling to passers-by and trickle along with the sodden dreg of lust into the steel toothed drains of dilapidated warehouses in a city filled with <a href="i_saw_you_in_los_angeles.html">purple hearts</a>.<br>
        </p></body></html>
