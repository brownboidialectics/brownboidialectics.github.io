        <h1>sitting at the center…</h1><pre><span class="inner-pre" style="font-family: Garamond, Baskerville, 'Baskerville Old Face', 'Hoefler Text', 'Times New Roman', serif;">sitting at the center of orange box house rooftop
on Andean hills
lay la Tunda
with her head pressed against the belly of the shaman
who sat crosslegged on ashes
<a href="Rufino.html">expounding scripture</a>
slurring palenquero
supple lips dribbling juice
of amazon,            
	green lotus root.
the tunda’s mind is tortured 
she held up a rose and said </span></pre>
<blockquote>
    “this Shaman I shall never be,<br> 
	 never love, but a symbol of lust <br> 
 	 only recognized by those who sleep <br> 
	 on fleeting sunbeams. <br> 
	 For I am the sinking furnace in which the fire is <br> 
	 feeding and breathing needs and wants <br> 
	 desires breeding <br> 
	 and me <br> 
 	 i’m just guano <br> 
	
 	shaman sing me a song or a hymn that will season me,<br> 
  	that will make me butterfly bloom<br> 
  	let me see the true memory<br> 
  	visions of soil beds <br> 
        </blockquote>
<p>
the shaman turned to her and said<br>
<br>  
“mankind has drowned you in translucent oceans of blue<br> 
truth hidden deep beneath the sea<br>
in underwater labyrinth hedge mazes; experiment”<br>
</p>
        
<pre><span class="inner-pre" style="font-family: Garamond, Baskerville, 'Baskerville Old Face', 'Hoefler Text', 'Times New Roman', serif;">the Tunda closed her eyes, and drank from the juice
of amazon, 
	<a href="mother.html">green lotus root</a>    
and put her tortured mind to rest 
the slow breath inducing coma mid nirvana<br>
the shaman’s face remained still
	as he picked up the rose beginning to wilt 
		struggling to let go of la Tunda 
				and said 
</span></pre>
<p><center>
“May valleys weep<br> 
and laugh<br> 
and cry<br> 
and sing<br> 
with the voice of sky and sun”<br>
